I can successfully create, scale and optimize software portfolios. 
- I put the customer at the center of all that I do
- I excel at the execution of big ideas with given constraints
-My gut instinct is good but I seek data for my decisions. 

I can align, lead and grow product teams
- I love to win, but helping the team win gives me greater joy
- I speak tech and exec
- I tell great narratives that motivate
- The buck always stops with me

I educate, refine and drive myself to be a better person
- I am constantly learning because I never settle
- I stay calm when faced with adversity
- I focus on making high-quality decisions

I enjoy meeting new people and hearing new perspectives. Reach out if you want to talk to me about emerging tech, creating software product or basketball.
